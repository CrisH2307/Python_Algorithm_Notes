# Understanding Dynamic Programming: From Recursion to DP

This guide will help you understand Dynamic Programming (DP) by starting from basic recursion and gradually building up to more advanced DP concepts. Perfect for beginners!

## 1. Basic Recursion

Let's start with simple recursion. This is the foundation of everything we'll learn.

### Example 1: Fibonacci Sequence
```python
# Basic recursive solution
def fib(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
```

**What's happening?**
1. We break the problem into smaller subproblems
2. We solve each subproblem recursively
3. We combine the results

**Problem**: This is very slow! It recalculates the same values many times.

### Example 2: Factorial
```python
# Basic recursive solution
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    return n * factorial(n-1)
```

**What's happening?**
1. We break the problem into smaller subproblems
2. We solve each subproblem recursively
3. We combine the results

**Key Points**:
- Recursion is great for breaking problems down
- It's like solving a puzzle piece by piece
- The base case stops the recursion

## 2. Memoization (Top-Down DP)

Let's improve our recursive solution by storing results we've already calculated.

### Example 1: Fibonacci with Memoization
```python
# Top-Down with Memoization
def fib(n, memo={}):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    if n not in memo:
        memo[n] = fib(n-1, memo) + fib(n-2, memo)
    return memo[n]
```

**Key Points**:
1. We store results in a dictionary (`memo`)
2. Before calculating, we check if we already know the answer
3. This is called "Top-Down" because we start from the top (n) and break it down

### Example 2: Factorial with Memoization
```python
# Top-Down with Memoization
def factorial(n, memo={}):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    if n not in memo:
        memo[n] = n * factorial(n-1, memo)
    return memo[n]
```

**Key Points**:
- We avoid redundant calculations
- We store results in a dictionary
- We check before calculating

## 3. Tabulation (Bottom-Up DP)

Instead of starting from the top, let's start from the bottom and build up.

### Example 1: Fibonacci with Tabulation
```python
# Bottom-Up with Tabulation
def fib(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp[0] = 0
    dp[1] = 1
    
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]
    
    return dp[n]
```

**Key Points**:
1. We use an array (`dp`) to store results
2. We fill the array from bottom (0) to top (n)
3. We never calculate the same value twice

### Example 2: Factorial with Tabulation
```python
# Bottom-Up with Tabulation
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp[0] = 1
    
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        dp[i] = i * dp[i-1]
    
    return dp[n]
```

**Key Points**:
- We build solutions step by step
- We use an array to store intermediate results
- We avoid redundant calculations

## 4. Space Optimization

We can make our solution even better by using less memory!

### Example 1: Optimized Fibonacci
```python
# Space Optimized O(1) solution
def fib(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    
    # Only keep track of the last two numbers
    a, b = 0, 1
    for _ in range(2, n + 1):
        a, b = b, a + b
    
    return b
```

**Key Points**:
1. We only need the last two numbers
2. We don't need the whole array
3. This is O(1) space complexity!

### Example 2: Optimized Factorial
```python
# Space Optimized O(1) solution
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    
    # Only keep track of the current result
    result = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        result *= i
    
    return result
```

**Key Points**:
- Think about what values you really need
- Often can reduce space usage
- Keep only necessary previous states

## 5. Let's Try Another Problem: Climbing Stairs

You can climb 1 or 2 steps at a time. How many ways to climb n steps?

### Step 1: Basic Recursion
```python
def climbStairs(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return 1
    return climbStairs(n-1) + climbStairs(n-2)
```

**How it works**:
- If we're at step n, we could have come from step n-1 or step n-2
- We add the ways to reach n-1 and n-2
- Base case: 1 way to reach step 0 or 1

### Step 2: Memoization
```python
def climbStairs(n, memo={}):
    if n <= 1:
        return 1
    if n not in memo:
        memo[n] = climbStairs(n-1, memo) + climbStairs(n-2, memo)
    return memo[n]
```

**Key Points**:
- Store results in memo
- Check before calculating
- Avoid redundant calculations

### Step 3: Tabulation
```python
def climbStairs(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return 1
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp[0] = dp[1] = 1
    
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]
    
    return dp[n]
```

**Key Points**:
- Build solutions from bottom up
- Use array to store results
- No redundant calculations

### Step 4: Space Optimization
```python
def climbStairs(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return 1
    
    # Only need last two values
    a, b = 1, 1
    for _ in range(2, n + 1):
        a, b = b, a + b
    
    return b
```

**Key Points**:
- Only need last two values
- Reduced space usage
- Still O(1) space complexity
