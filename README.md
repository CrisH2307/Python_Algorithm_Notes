# Classification of Data Structure
## Linear Data Structures

## Non-Linear Data Structures
Non-linear data structures do not follow a sequential order; each element can connect to multiple elements, forming complex relationships.
1. Tree: A hierarchical structure with nodes connected by edges, commonly used for organizing hierarchical data like file systems.
2. Graph: A collection of nodes connected by edges, allowing versatile representation of relationships between various entities.
3. Heap: A specialized tree-based structure that satisfies the heap property, often used in priority queues and memory allocation.

#### The Need for Non-Linear Data Structures
+ Complex Relationships:
    Non-linear structures represent intricate relationships between elements, suitable for scenarios with intricate connections.
+ Hierarchical Organization: 
    Trees organize data hierarchically, making them ideal for structures like company organization charts.
+ Graph-based Modeling:
    Graphs enable modelling of various real-world networks, from social connections to computer networks.
+ Efficient Priority Management: 
        Heaps efficiently manage priority-based operations, such as extracting the highest-priority element.

#### Real-world Examples of Non-Linear Data Structures:
1. Tree:
    + File System: Organizing files in a hierarchical structure mirrors the tree concept, with directories as nodes and files as leaves.
    + Family Genealogy: Representing family relationships, like a family tree, illustrates the hierarchical nature of tree structures.
2. Graph:
    + Social Networks: Social media platforms model users and their connections using graph structures to facilitate friend suggestions.
    + Road Networks: Maps utilize graphs to represent roads and intersections, helping navigation systems find the shortest routes.
3. Heap:
    + Priority Queue: A hospital's patient queue can be modeled using a heap, with patients ordered by priority for efficient treatment.
    + Memory Allocation: The memory heap in programming languages allocates memory dynamically, utilizing heap data structure principles.
